        <h1>Hi, I'm Minh Nguyen</h1>
        <p>A passionate game developer from OCADU, I am inspired by games and art
        </p>
            <h2 style="font-size:1.25em">To me, games are a medium into world that has yet to be explored</h2>
            <p>From coding algorithms that breathe life into characters to designing immersive game mechanics, I find solace in the challenge of crafting interactive experiences. My days are punctuated with lines of code, moments of creative brainstorming, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>
            <p>In this ever-changing landscape, I am not merely a learner; I am an avid enthusiast, constantly evolving, adapting, and embracing the unknown. To me, game development is more than a skill – it’s a journey where every hurdle surmounted and every level created is a testament to my dedication.</p>
            <h1>My vision: let the unknown in me be known</h1>
