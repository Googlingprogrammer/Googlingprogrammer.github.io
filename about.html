            <h3>Back at home, Vietnam, my family would call me "Tin," after the comic "The Adventures of Tintin." This nickname held my father's love for western comics but also embodied the spirit of adventure and curiosity instilled in me from an early age. It was within the pages of these comics and many other stories of fantastical world that I first felt the stirrings of creativity and the desire to embark on thrilling journeys of my own.</h3>
            
            <p>My ambition is to delve into various aspects of game development, honing my skills in programming, design, and storytelling. With each of Tin's adventures, I aspire to bring the vivid worlds and compelling narratives of my imagination to life.</p>
            
            <p>Powered by curiosity and a drive to learn, I have multi-disciplinary skills across fields such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming in: Unity 3D and 2D, GameMaker Studio, P5.js, Front-end web development</li>
                <li>3D modeling in Blender and Maya</li>
                <li>Arts and animations in Photoshop, Procreate, and Aseprite</li>
